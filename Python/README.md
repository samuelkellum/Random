This repository contains all of my random python files, mostly created in the summer of 2019.
Everything that I created in the summer of 2019 I taught myself how to do, so please don't roast my code too hard, unless your name is: Samuel Kellum, Bennett Kahn (iffy), or Rico Coleman (even more iffy).
Cheers!
